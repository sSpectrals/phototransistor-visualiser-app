## Abstract

For my robotics team Roboticus, we needed a better way to monitor **32 phototransistor sensors** while detecting a white line. Simply reading raw serial values was inefficient so we built this real-time visualizer to:  
âœ” Clearly display which sensors are triggered  
âœ” Optimize debugging with instant visual feedback

---

## Features

- Live 2D representation of sensor positions
- Color-coded coordinates representing activation
- COM port selection when reading data

---

## How to use

1. Upload the arduino code to your microprocessor
2. Calibrate the coordinates for the visual in case of any specific shape of a pcb
3. Run the python code while the microprocessor is powered
4. Select the correct COM port
5. Enjoy the visual feedback

---

## Customization

Give coordinates for each sensor to match a specific shape (i.e. of a PCB).  
Useful if you need to detect only the right side gets activated or only the left.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sSpectrals/phototransistor-visualizer.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
   ```
